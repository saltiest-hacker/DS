This is described in a lot of details in the Code of Hammurabi. You just have to consider the fact that the Akkadian words describing a husband (be-el as-sa-tim) mean “owner of a wife” to realize that, just like a slave, a wife was considered to be a man’s property. A woman had to address her husband with “master” or “lord” just like a slave addresses his master or a subject his king. And to this day there are still cultures where the words used to describe a husband literally mean “owner of a wife.” Consider that in the bible, when god decides to create a woman, he does so to create a “helper” for the man, later adding that “man shall rule over woman.” In the ten commandments, a wife is also listed among the properties of a man (a woman was considered first to be the property of her father, and after marriage her husband). In some verses in the bible the Hebrew words that describe a married woman, or a wife, literally mean “woman with a master.”3<p>So a woman became the property of a man upon “marrying” him, and was sold by her father in a way comparable to slavery. The future owner of such a woman would have to pay her father the price he requested for his daughter and a contract was made detailing the terms of the transaction.4 This is where the traditions we still have today in certain cultures around the world come from, where the parents of the bride are given money and presents in return for their daughter.

2020-08-24 17:45:54+00:00,,,Rusky,,,"&gt; The solution is simple, write a safe wrapper, that uses `unsafe` once.<p>This is the thing I&#x27;m calling a cop-out. Chromium wants to avoid the error-prone boilerplate of writing out all those safe wrappers, by asserting <i>in a single place</i> that a whole collection of C++ functions are always safe to call with any arguments that match their (generated Rust-side) type.<p>&gt; That wasn&#x27;t my read of their comment. If that&#x27;s what they want, then the patched `cxx` crate which requires `unsafe` would give them exactly this.<p>Yes, this is what I have been telling you. The Chromium document also says this at the end of point #1: &quot;This particular property is satisfied by dtolnay’s marvellous cxx library already.&quot;<p>&gt; &gt; The key issue that people get worked up about, is that all C++ is unsafe,<p>&gt;<p>&gt; This is not what we are talking about here. Lot of C++ code is safe, and writing a safe wrapper over C++ that&#x27;s obviously safe is a one liner.<p>We need to be careful with terminology here. All C++ code <i>is</i> unsafe in the sense that its soundness is unchecked by the compiler. Some C++ is <i>also</i> unsafe in the sense of an `unsafe fn`, placing additional expectations on its callers which are not captured by the type signature.<p>I&#x27;m repeating myself now, but it is <i>absolutely</i> possible to take a C++ header file, review the functions it declares, and decide &quot;yes, the wrappers generated by cxx for these functions would all be sound.&quot; This is the case where autocxx helps- assuming you have such a header file, generating a bunch of safe wrappers is much less error prone than writing and maintaining them by hand.<p>You are correct that Vulkan&#x2F;Wayland&#x2F;etc. are usually not conducive to this. But that is why I linked that Reddit comment- the Chromium devs invoking cxx <i>also</i> control the APIs they&#x27;re feeding it! The reply you linked is <i>not</i> talking about calling Rust from C++, but about this approach of calling C++ <i>which you also own</i> from Rust.<p>Once you control both sides of the language boundary, changes to the header are a totally different matter.

Chromium wants to avoid the error-prone boilerplate of writing out all those safe wrappers, by asserting <i>in a single place</i> that a whole collection of C++ functions are always safe to call with any arguments that match their (generated Rust-side) type.<p>&gt; That wasn't my read of their comment. If that's what they want, then the patched `cxx` crate which requires `unsafe` would give them exactly this.<p>Yes, this is what I have been telling you. The Chromium document also says this at the end of point #1: &quot;This particular property is satisfied by dtolnay’s marvellous cxx library already.&quot;<p>&gt; &gt; The key issue that people get worked up about, is that all C++ is unsafe,<p>&gt;<p>&gt; This is not what we are talking about here. Lot of C++ code is safe, and writing a safe wrapper over C++ that's obviously safe is a one liner.<p>We need to be careful with terminology here. All C++ code <i>is</i> unsafe in the sense that its soundness is unchecked by the compiler. Some C++ is <i>also</i> unsafe in the sense of an `unsafe fn`, placing additional expectations on its callers which are not captured by the type signature.<p>I'm repeating myself now, but it is <i>absolutely</i> possible to take a C++ header file, review the functions it declares, and decide &quot;yes, the wrappers generated by cxx for these functions would all be sound.&quot; This is the case where autocxx helps- assuming you have such a header file, generating a bunch of safe wrappers is much less error prone than writing and maintaining them by hand.<p>You are correct that Vulkan/Wayland/etc. are usually not conducive to this.
