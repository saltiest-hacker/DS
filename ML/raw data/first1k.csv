1,,,I would like to point out some counter-examples:<p>«<i>Think of journalists. Many are losing their jobs. Newspapers are barely surviving. In the old days for every news event there were probably hundreds of journalists writing about the same story for their own local newspapers. Now because of the efficiency of the Internet and search engines a few journalists writing about it would suffice for the whole country. People would be able to find them. There is no reason why hundreds of newspapers should write and publish their own versions of the same story.</i>»<p>And yet you can still find incompetent people.  I've read so many inaccuracies grammar and typographic mistakes from information <i>professionals</i> (apparently) that makes me wonder if the price to pay for such efficiency is too high.  And I'm talking as a consumer information consumer.<p>«<i>Corporations are increasingly getting bigger (in terms of market caps) more global and more powerful yet they are getting smaller and smaller in terms of the number of people they employ because they have mastered the art of efficiency.</i>»<p>Okay take IKEA for example.  IKEA sells furniture and other home accessories world wide and everywhere you can find the same model.  However how many people do they employ on each store?  A hundred?  I don't know but I'm under the impression that is not a shrinking number.  And IKEA is a particularly good example because it's expansion model is not based on a franchise like fast food restaurants.<p>Of course I might not understood the intention of the author.,,etanol,,1319395600.0,comment,3146879,3145330.0,,,,2011-10-23T18:46:40Z

But if manual deployment takes at most 10 to 20 minutes and relatively straightforward then it might be less of a case. Depending on how often you deploy also impacts this greatly.

  who strives valiantly; who errs

75,,,There is absolutely no law of economics that says that wages can&#x27;t decrease. Wages are based on the supply and demand of labor and there is no question that robots will affect that. If the wages fall below minimum wage or even what it is feasible to survive on then you get unemployment.<p>Most human jobs for most of history have been unskilled work. Things anyone could be trained to do not requiring high intelligence and involving physical or repetitive work. The industrial revolution moved unskilled laborers from farms to factories but there were still jobs.<p>But with near future tech there will be <i>very</i> few things if anything unskilled humans can do that robots can&#x27;t. We are just starting to see AI good enough that it can match humans in visual recognition tasks - which 10 years ago was unthinkable and progress incredibly slow. This level of AI has been the main limitation to robots. We&#x27;ve had decent robots but AI wasn&#x27;t good enough to use them for anything interesting. Now it is.<p>Soon robots will take over almost all existing jobs. From truck drivers to shelf stockers to the mail man.<p>Of course there will be jobs that AI can&#x27;t do (for now.) E.g. computer programmers or doctors. But realistically what percent of the population can actually do those jobs? What percent of unemployed truck drivers are actually going to be able to retrain as computer programmers?,,Houshalter,,1456844429.0,comment,11202951,11202445.0,,,,2016-03-01T15:00:29Z

83,,,Correction. We spend cash because we need or want things. If the utility I get from the thing I'm want to buy give me greater satisfaction today than the value I gain in the future from inflation then I will still spend the money. It's all about marginal utility.<p>If bitcoins are deflating rapidly those bitcoins have greater marginal utility if you hold on to them. However if they are deflating very slowly (not inertially) then people will spend them to get something that provides greater marginal utility now.<p>Humans are capable of putting a price on time (determine the marginal utility of time). Inflation is not the only economic circumstance that works for trade to occur. Economics is very relative and reflexive. The only entity that truly loses in a deflationary environment is the government because they can't steal from its constituents by printing money and devaluing the money its constituents are holding.<p>More important than deflation or inflation is relative temporal constituency in the value of money. So long as money stays are relatively the same value for long stretches of time i.e. it isn't volatile then humans are <i>afforded</i> circumstances in which they can make <i>rational</i> judgements of value and utility.,,malandrew,,1361154302.0,comment,5237804,5232304.0,,,,2013-02-18T02:25:02Z

Companies tend to re-invest the money as much as possible so they avoid paying a lot of taxes (which I think is a good thing in general).<p>The only problem appears when they do make a lot of profit but manage to transfer it to other subsidiaries in other countries so they pay much less profit there. I don't know if that's what Amazon did but I'd keep in mind that while Amazon's revenues are high their profits are usually very small.,,mtgx,,1368700268.0,comment,5717785,5717580.0,,,,2013-05-16T10:31:08Z

DeWitt. DeWitt is an academic expert in parallel SQL databases.<p>DeWitt says that in MapReduce ""schema is buried"" and furthermore ""the programmer must discover the structure by an examination of the code. Not only is this a very tedious exercise but also the programmer must find the source code for the application.""<p>Ever heard of Hive ?
<a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/GettingStarted#SQL_Operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/GettingStarted#SQL_Operat...</a><p>But he does make one important point - ""whether a DBMS should be written:
a. By stating what you want ( Relational DBMS )
b. By presenting an algorithm for data access ( Codasyl MapReduce)<p>Well mathematically speaking 'a' wins hands down since you've normalized the data &#38; have ""no garbage in the data set"" ( DeWitt's terminology ) . However once you have a  fast-enough access potentially infinite memory to handle thousands of columns &#38; millions of rows then there's no reason not to atleast try to do a Codasyl. In that respect Codasyl is like say a bubblesort. If you're going to be sorting atmost 10 elements a million times in your application you would be better off with a quick and dirty bubblesort which actually performs faster in this particular case than a correctly written MergeSort which will do a lot better if you have a million elements but will perform poorly if you have just 10 elements ( O(1<i>n^2) = 100 O(5</i>10*ln(10)) = 115 ). When I first learnt DBMSs in school the Professor actually made this very point - ""someday we'll attempt a Codasyl just not right now.""

126,,,"On a related but no quite note I&#x27;ve got a personal vendetta against sales pages that think buzzing and zipping jQuery is anywhere near to being a sensible idea.<p>&lt;rantyrant&gt;
So from a personal standpoint if I&#x27;m on your sales page I want to know what you&#x27;re offering and why I should be intrested in what you are offering. I&#x27;d be fine with that being a plain html site with nothing but a few paragraphs and some bullet point lists. Maybe a table or two as well and a link to somewhere I can give you money.<p>Now the last thing I need is for that part of the page to zoom in wiggle around or do any other bogheaded things a designer with just enough jQuery to be dangerous could think of whilst they&#x27;re being &quot;creative&quot; with it.<p>Now from a marketing perspective this is incredibly stupid. A sales page is a machine for turning prospects into customers. There&#x27;s a single design purpose if there is one. If someone come over and tried to paint flowers on the tip of my soldering iron I would cut them. If someone decided to replace my PSU with a music box because the music box looks a lot better I would not be pleased.<p>So why did it ever become a thing to  do that to one of the most essential parts of your business? The part you point your advertising money at. The part that can very well be the difference between you going the way of the ipod or the way of the zune.  Go nuts on your About page if you really have to keep your designer busy have your faces zoom into it and spin and put the text into maquee tags and what have. But please for the love of god don&#x27;t don&#x27;t ever do that to your sales page because you&#x27;re wasting my time and your money on that.<p>I blame marketing professionals with an IQ of 50 and designers with delusions of grandeur CSS3 on the holster jQuery in their hands trigger happy on anything customer facing spreading more $ signs through the site than the rap business.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;",,solistice,,1441470832.0,comment,10175258,10174879.0,,,,2015-09-05T16:33:52Z

They&#x27;d have to have access to Cendyn&#x27;s DNS server&#x27;s logs.<p>The reason I count the story as false is that all the available evidence points to it being an ordinary mass mailing system: the horde of similar domains owned by Cendyn for the other hotels they do business with the e-mails from it that have been found the long trail of evidence showing Cendyn have been in this business for two decades and have had the Trump Organisation as a customer for 9 years the existence of numerous DNS lookups not in the original logs offered by those pushing the story...

209,,,This is the truth. The late &#x27;90s antitrust case arose after many many years of what many would consider anticompetitive abuse of market dominance.<p>One example: there were various competitors to MS-DOS and Windows throughout the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. However due to their relationship with IBM MS had a huge natural advantage in the PC OS market in the early- to mid-&#x27;80s. They pressed this advantage to enforce licensing fees on computer makers. If a company wanted to sell an MS OS on any of their computers they had to pay MS for a license for every computer regardless of which OS was sold on it. This guaranteed that any system sold without an MS OS would cost more because the customer had to buy the computer + the MS OS + OtherOS even if the MS OS wasn&#x27;t installed on the purchased system. This created a huge barrier to entry for any MS competitor in the OS market.<p>Software vendors are within their rights to make such deals of course. It&#x27;s only a problem if the vendor has so much of a market presence that it would be suicide for a system vendor to decline from being an MS reseller altogether. In this case it was a problem.<p>This illustrates some aspects of antitrust law that a lot of people misunderstand:<p>(1) Being a monopoly doesn&#x27;t mean having 100% market share it only means having overwhelmingly dominant market share which in some industries could be as small as 30%. It&#x27;s a somewhat arbitrary number that might be very different from one industry to the next.<p>(2) Being a monopoly is not a bad thing in and of itself. There is a concept of some industries being skewed towards natural monopolies. Natural monopolies aren&#x27;t inherently bad things either.<p>(3) Antitrust action is only taken when someone abuses their monopoly to alter the very market that they compete in. This is using your strength in the market to bias the market itself in favor of you thus undermining free market dynamics. Of course no market is 100% free or rational or efficient but that doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters is that the monopolist is taking steps to make it tangibly less free.<p>Unfortunately the nature of antitrust law is such that it is ripe for abuse by bad actors or (legitimately) vanquished competitors. As a result even seemingly clearcut situations like the MS OEM deals go on for years without anything being done about it because there are inherently so many legal gray areas surrounding antitrust. But it did establish a record of patterns of behavior that could be referenced in the eventual late &#x27;90s antitrust case.<p>IANAL so this should be taken with many grains of salt and I would love to hear from actual L&#x27;s if any of this is wrong or oversimplified.,,mwfunk,,1467667655.0,comment,12033104,12032487.0,,,,2016-07-04T21:27:35Z

223,,,It&#x27;s like LEGO - you have some basic building blocks and you can compose some cool things with them. Your first LEGO set has only 3 different blocks but nevertheless you make some nice tools just with them. Then some smart person adds another 2 blocks later. Then another 3 blocks. Then an electric engine. Suddenly your scope becomes much bigger.

230,,,"It&#x27;s not just about beauty but experience. Imagine you have a spreadsheet with infinite rows where each row contributes to the Higgs mass. It also turns out that by and large each row contributes less than the previous. You can&#x27;t calculate all of them but calculating the bigger ones you can do pretty well. Now imagine someone plops in infinity into one of the rows sure the rest could all just happen to contribute a small amount and conspire to add up and cancel that out (because the mass isn&#x27;t infinite) but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like the world we live in.

That might save everyone a lot of bandwidth.<p>Of course people shouldn&#x27;t really be installing their gems from ruby gems on servers anyway is there any way to prod bundler to make it default to package gems and do a local install where possible rather than downloading them every time there is a deploy (the current default)? At present you use double bandwidth from people downloading once on their local machine and once on their server to update.<p>Fetching the ruby gems index with bundler&#x2F;rubygems still takes a while every time I bundle update have you looked at optimising that part of the process further (at least it doesn&#x27;t fetch a list of all gems now but it still fetches a list of all versions of each gem doesn&#x27;t it?) say caching older gem results?

Most stuff isn&#x27;t stolen even though it is very difficult to catch someone breaking into houses<p>There&#x27;s a book called Three Felonies A Day which posits that the average American commits three serious crimes every day despite the overwhelming majority of those folks not meaning to.  <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?#q=three+felonies+a+day"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;webhp?#q=three+felonies+a+day</a>  The reason for this is that the laws are written broadly enough that entirely innocent acts could be construed to be strict-liability crimes that require absolute adherence; intent does not enter into the equation.<p>If society is not falling apart even if the average American is in fact committing three felonies a day then it stands to reason that perhaps the law as a whole is over-written and could stand to be reduced.

The theory goes that compulsion is a very ephemeral threat and that the police can&#x27;t be everywhere at once ticketing everyone who&#x27;s speeding all the time and people know it.

Has Google ever complied with these requests?<p>3. How much of this content was pulled because of blasphemy reasons?<p>4. Is it the official policy of US government to try to censure any speech which can cause negative reaction from violent extremists abroad or there some violent extremists that US government is more afraid of than others? If so who takes these decisions and is his salary paid from my taxes?<p>Ideally these questions would be answered by the free press.

296,,,"At the risk of coming off as one of the maligned ""personal opinion"" people I have to object a little to (2). That may be the general issue I could agree but it's not <i>my</i> issue.<p>Because <i>my</i> issue is the sheer <i>length</i> and <i>complexity</i> of the GPL; I have read it and I do not pretend to understand it and I don't personally as a developer want to release under a license whose implications I don't really understand. The problems just start with Section 1 and accumulate from there.<p>For me the nastiest part is not really the copyleft or DRM so much as the no-linking aspect of GPL. I still don't know what precisely constitutes ""linking"". I don't know whether Python is in violation of the GPL because the standard library has a readline module and I don't know if my own code is in violation of the GPL because it's written in Python. GPLv3 actually made this point a little clearer; in GPLv3 you would say ""Python as a whole plus its readline library is probably GPL but as long as you don't write 'import readline' you could probably release under something else instead."" Now that there is a BSD version of readline called editline I wonder if even that analysis holds. But the GPL makes even this analysis complicated because if Python <i>forgot to mention</i> that the whole package was GPL then actually their license to readline can potentially be revoked <i>at any time</i> by the readline copyright holders.<p>And there are some nasty parts too like the ongoing incompatibility between the Eclipse Public License and the GPL. You now have people explaining how to get readline and wrap Clojure in a readline interface (which is allowed) because Clojure presumably isn't allowed to connect directly to readline in its own REPL.<p>LGPL at least I don't have to worry about this crap when building an application which uses yours as a tool. You can license under LGPL if you really think that GPL's legal phrasing is absolutely magnificent and you love it. I don't want to release under such an ugly license myself and GPL forces me to violate my aesthetic principles.<p>So never mind some guy whining about GPL over here.

338,,,<i>The accident investigation team concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed. Specifically the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.<p>The investigation team identified several credible causes for the COPV failure all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX in buckles under the overwrap. The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads. In the long term SpaceX will implement design changes to the COPVs to prevent buckles altogether which will allow for faster loading operations.​<p>SpaceX is targeting return to flight from Vandenberg&#x27;s Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) with the Iridium NEXT launch on January 8.</i><p>Are COPVs a universal thing in rocketry?

340,,,EDIT: I&#x27;ve been chewing over the following:<p>&gt; This means that we can trivially translate a dynamically typed program into a statically typed program though obviously we don&#x27;t gain anything by that at this point (this is essentially an argument that Bob Harper has advanced before) and we pay for it in additional verbosity.<p>This is exactly the opposite of the argument I advance below; you&#x27;re claiming that there <i>is</i> a &quot;local&quot; translation from dynamic to static. And on reflection you might be right but I&#x27;m not entirely sure. It hinges on exactly what counts as &quot;local&quot;. Translating away exceptions for example requires inserting case-analyses which propagate an exception if one has been thrown literally everywhere in your program. It&#x27;s &quot;global&quot; in the sense that it touches every node in the program; it&#x27;s &quot;local&quot; in the sense that the transformations performed don&#x27;t involve any global knowledge or analysis. I&#x27;m rereading Felleisen&#x27;s paper now to see how precisely he defines things.<p>ORIGINAL:<p>&gt; I had Matthias Felleisen&#x27;s characterization of expressiveness [1] in mind (incidentally he&#x27;s also one of Racket&#x27;s authors).<p>Great! I believe by that definition your assertion that &quot;good&quot; typesystems don&#x27;t reduce expressiveness is false at least for common type systems such as Haskell&#x27;s Java&#x27;s ML&#x27;s etc. There are plenty of programs which require non-local rewriting (&quot;a global reorganization of the entire program&quot;) in order to appease the typechecker.<p>A simple example can be adapted from the expression problem: suppose I&#x27;m writing an compiler for a simple language so I have an AST datatype and some functions on it. Then I add a pass to my compiler that removes a certain feature from the language I&#x27;m implementing - a certain branch of the AST. Now I wish to simplify my backend by removing the case which handles this branch of the AST. I cannot do that without either dynamically failing in that case (which a type system might even prevent me from doing) or introducing an entirely new AST type which does not have that branch - but this could require duplicating or else considerably generalizing existing code that operates on the AST (a global reorganization). Of course a sufficiently powerful typesystem might let me do that but for any typesystem you name I suspect a similar example can be procured.<p>To get more precise the &quot;feature&quot; we&#x27;re considering adding is &quot;ignoring the typechecker and running anyway&quot;. For example GHC&#x27;s -fdefer-type-errors. The question is &quot;can any legitimate program written with -fdefer-type-errors be locally translated into an equivalent program that typechecks without -fdefer-type-errors&quot;. Without reaching for an explicit escape hatch like unsafeCoerce (which is analogous to &quot;unsafe&quot; blocks in Rust) I think the answer is no.,,rntz,,1485280466.0,comment,13473697,13472489.0,,,,2017-01-24T17:54:26Z

342,,,What saddens me about all this is that the trend away from cars also represents a trend away from <i>freedom.</i><p>If you have a car that you can drive you can travel pretty much as you please subject to the availability of time and economic resources (e.g. fuel vehicle maintenance).  Without one you are either restricted to the distance you can travel on foot (or via human-powered devices like bicycles which extend that range some but not to a great extent) or you become dependent on others to provide you the service of transportation...and in many cases those services are either heavily regulated by government (e.g. airlines trains traditional taxi services) or outright <i>provided</i> by government (e.g. municipal buses and light rail).  This gives the government the ability to arbitrarily deny the freedom to travel at its whim (e.g. the &quot;no-fly&quot; list).<p>Of the three trends cited electric cars least affect the freedom to travel though their limited range compared to vehicles with an IC engine might infringe somewhat.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on communication with external services for their navigation and operation and this provides a chokepoint where government can exert pressure.  And we&#x27;ve certainly seen how governments are responding to the rise of ride-sharing services by attempting to regulate them which is still an ongoing controversy.<p>Is there anyone out there that is seriously addressing the threat to freedom that the demise of the traditional car represents?,,erbo,,1453147351.0,comment,10926523,10923216.0,,,,2016-01-18T20:02:31Z

I even keep getting the similar &quot;link training failed&quot; messages with ATI.<p>The connection seems to work fine if you get it working once and treat the cable like it&#x27;s cursed and avoid touching anything ever.<p>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the monitor or the connection in general though. What I do know is that the monitor also <i>buzzes</i> when there&#x27;s lots of text on the screen (i.e. just open Wikipedia in a browser) which drives me insane at night if it&#x27;s silent.

392,,,The effect of dropping a reference is sometimes predictable. For example Color cannot root a large object graph so dropping a reference to Color will deallocate at most one object. At least it does not require nonsense like Android&#x27;s allocation-in-onDraw warning.<p>I worked on the now-deprecated GC for Cocoa frameworks and we made heavy use of weak references for out-of-line storage. This put us at risk for cycles: if A references B through a weak-to-strong global map and B in turn references A we have an uncollectible cycle even under GC. This represented a large class of bugs we encountered under GC.<p>So both GC and RC have their classes of cycles and unpredictable behavior. I&#x27;ve come to believe that these techniques are more related than we&#x27;d like to admit and the real difference is in their second order effects. For example GC enables lockless hash tables which require hazard pointers or other awkward techniques under RC. On the other hand RC enables cheap copy-on-write which is how Swift&#x27;s collections can be value types.,,ridiculous_fish,,1440307471.0,comment,10104764,10104576.0,,,,2015-08-23T05:24:31Z

Then you realize goat is so valuable so you use your $100 to buy two goats from neighbor for $50 each. Now your neighbor realizes what&#x27;s going on and he uses his new money plus some more buy more goats - all in anticipation that everyone needs goat and prices will keep going up. The virtuous cycle starts and sooner or later major portions of people&#x27;s money keeps changing hands in form of million dollar goats.

I agree with Kay here about TBL &#38; Co being shortsighted in what the web could have become if a richer interactive experience instead of a document based experience had been considered from inception.<p>Look at Twitter. That's not a document. That's an application. Each tweet in the interface is a document. Every tweet in that feed is a document that has been ""transcluded"" into the app Twitter built on top of  a document. There needs to be a standard way to ""transclude"" documents with reference URL that allows interactivity. The fact that the only hyperlinking option we have today is the &#60;a&#62; tag is unfortunate. There need to be more ways of hyperlinking than an &#60;a&#62; tag.

436,,,There is some historical precedence.  However I'm not sure if we have any precedent for what is happening in engineering.  Medical MBA and even law schools do admit international students of course and engineering graduate programs should too.  Our schools would be much weaker if we limited ourselves to US born students and the experience of all students would be poorer for it.  But the percentage of US born students has dropped so severely in graduate engineering programs that I think we're in uncharted and dangerous waters here.<p>When I was a grad student in engineering at Berkeley (about a decade ago now) I become accustomed to being the only person who grew up in the US in class study groups and so forth.  For the reasons I described above I think this is a dangerous situation for the US.  In fact I actually think that our graduate engineering schools (this is based on my limited experience at Berkeley) are starting to assume a European or Asian type of undergraduate preparation where students tend to specialize earlier than an American one where we do more general education and specialize later.  While I actually think that Americans from <i>top</i> undergraduate colleges are very well educated they probably aren't at the same point in their particular branch of study as international students who have studied their subjects more exclusively as undergraduates so we may soon be at a point where the structure of US graduate education in engineering is less accessible to people who have come up through our own education system.<p>By analogy supposed you majored in English and went to law school having never taken a law class.  That's how it works in the US.  Now imagine if 95% of your classmates spent the last 4 years at Oxford studying common law including substantial amounts of study of the US legal system.  Well you'd struggle no matter how wonderful an undergrad student you'd been.  I think this structural shift is well underway in US based graduate engineering programs.<p>Interestingly US students do enroll in undergraduate engineering programs because those degrees pay.  They just tend to avoid graduate programs in favor of law business and medicine - and if you look at the numbers it's hard to conclude that this is not a highly rational decision.,,geebee,,1269301452.0,comment,1211731,1211623.0,,,,2010-03-22T23:44:12Z

453,Ask HN: Should I launch anyway if unhappy about my product?,,"I've been working on my startup full-time for 13 months now. (http://taketake.com)<p>I can't seem to nail that design - that feeling I'm looking for. We've changed the UI and the design roughly 5 times now. 6 months ago I stumbled on the Lean Startup philosophy; the launch early scrappy and iterate doing customer development. I kept telling myself that I will launch in a few weeks so it was too late to ""start from scratch"" and apply the Lean Startup idea. But it's been 6 months now and I can't seem to get out of this stupid cycle of me being unhappy and wanting to have everything perfect before I launch.<p>Because of this other startups like Blippy Swipely (and gdgt to some extent) beat me to the push. My reaction when I saw this was to try harder and build features they don't have - so that when I launch our site we would one-up them.<p>Now I feel like I was wrong. I should have launched months ago and done more customer development to make sure I'm not building something people won't care about.<p>Somehow it is so difficult for me to release something that is not perfect. I can hear Gary V. telling me to ""quit the bitch train"" and launch already.<p>At this point I have three competitors; gdgt Blippy and Swipely. They've got big launches with lots of PR attention and now getting traction while I'm losing my time pixel by pixel.<p>I guess I'm scared of failing and don't want to launch because of that - or I'm trying to pull a Steve Jobs with the resources of a non-VC backed startup.<p>Should I just take my time and release when I'm happy about my product and not care about my competitors getting traction - or should I hurry to get in the market to get my piece of the pie asap?<p>Your thoughts are appreciated :)",,mattbell,9.0,1278096658.0,story,1481955,,26.0,,,2010-07-02T18:50:58Z

484,,,"This is incredible. I think a few things are worth noting:<p>1) these &quot;terrible idea&quot; hackathon projects were so much more _sexual_ than your typical hackathon. This goes with the indications that the sex-tech space is anathema more for market reasons (VCs want to stay family friendly) than because sex-tech isn&#x27;t fun or interesting to people. With the chance of funding not on the table a healthy mix of projects veered toward sex. Maybe humor can actually be a way for a few sex-tech startups to take off. :)<p>2) the funniest projects all involved hardware. There&#x27;s something extra-ridiculous about juxtaposing our own bodies into these stupid projects. I recommend anyone interested in a solid philosophical grounding in humor to read Henri Bergson&#x27;s early 20th century treatise on laughter (<a href=""http://www.templeofearth.com/books/laughter.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.templeofearth.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;laughter.pdf</a>). He writes that we find use laughter as a way to draw attention to the rigid mortal and physical in all of us. That is why impersonating someone&#x27;s habits is funny-- because the rigidity of their personality is made super clear.

516,,,&#62;We need a new economic model for goods with real production cost but no reproduction cost.<p>Not only do I think that is impossible but I'm not convinced that it is a good idea. Has any economist ever done any quantitative analysis when the marginal cost of (re)production is zero?  I suspect that there are only obvious models that answer the question by saying that goods with production costs of zero should be priced at zero. In the short term there are all sorts of things you can do to maximize profits when the marginal cost is zero but in the long run the price will fall to zero.<p>This wistful hope that recorded music will be worth anything is kind of like my wistful hope that a viable economic system will come along that doesn't have a nasty tendency to concentrate the wealth in the hands of those that already have the capital.<p>Is that future you hope for really better than the one where something with a marginal cost of zero is priced in the market as it should be? I strongly suspect that the total amount of music recorded over time will continue to increase even as the cost falls to zero. I'm not sure what is so great about being able to sell digital music anyways.

I have tested our games and numerous other games with 100&#x27;s of kids and I can unequivocally say that in my &#x27;subjective&#x27; experience replacing workbooks&#x2F;textbooks with ipads is much better for kids. iPads should serve as a tool to optimize education.<p>The argument that these teachers don&#x27;t know how to use them is complete BS. For every 50 year old teacher there is a young 23 yr old TFA graduate who is vastly superior at integrating technology. As a society you cannot make decisions based on accommodating the ever shrinking population of teachers that is too old to work with technology.<p>Amplify is hardly the example of disruption they are a big company with around a thousand employees led by a former superintendent who greases the superintendents all over the country. They have the resources to esentially &#x27;buy-out&#x27; schools. Schools in turn let themselves be bought out rather than evaluate all the options due to district procurement rules. Good tehnology for ed will only be available if there is an easy way to test products in schools since most good tech is iterative. We have to go through so many barriers to do this on a school level but I have linked up with enough good teachers who understand its value and are willing to put in the time and effort to do so.<p>I have faced many of the same questions from parents that this article comes up with. Those are nothing new. The question is not about tablets or or no tablets its the fact that all computers will be tablets (or some form of touch devices) in 5 years. If that is the only computer that is going to be available to us then schools and teachers need to learn how to assimilate it.,,ahsanhilal,,1379007065.0,comment,6375513,6373963.0,,,,2013-09-12T17:31:05Z

Add in experience that you can prove yourself by talking about and suddenly grades matter a lot less – you still have to pass your classes and understand the material but the experiences prove your competence in combination with the grade.<p>Not everyone developing a product has to be an engineer so if you want a lot more technicians fine.  But you still need a good portion of engineers with the full depth of knowledge. People who program don&#x27;t necessarily understand this because a lot of programming work is technician work that you can teach yourself.

555,Why mobile app success is more than just download numbers,http://venturebeat.com/2011/04/07/mobile-app-success/?source=facebook,This discussion about mobile economy is one of the five themes we will be focusing on at theVentureBeat Mobile Summit on April 25-26. We’ve carefully invited the top executives in mobile to discuss the biggest challenges of the day which if solved can lead to much faster growth in the industry. And at our enterprise session we’ll have top executives around the table from a number of companies including Verizon AT&#38;T Sybase Qualcomm Box.net and more. (If you think you should be part of the discussionyou can apply for a ticket.)<p>Over the past three years the mobile landscape has been dominated by big numbers. Hundreds of thousands of apps on millions of devices downloaded billions of times. It’s like the early days of the Web all over again. Think unique Website visitors and page views. A lot of numbers but with what net result?<p>A million downloads can make for a nice story but they really don’t tell anything interesting and they don’t equal success. It’s very difficult to build a business on a $0.99 app let alone on a free one.<p>Along with downloads being mobile’s incorrect measurement we’ve seen executions missing just as often. People have been trying to take what worked on the Web and shove it at mobile. But the rules are different now so you have to change how you think about treat and present content within the new medium.<p>As the conversation shifts away from download data to engagement data it’s clear that the winners in the next three years will be those brands that have figured out how to drive engagement and create a conversation with their users through their apps.<p>Mobile is by its very nature an intent-driven platform. You pick up your phone to make a phone call check your email look up sports scores or play a game while waiting in line. Successful mobile apps have learned to take advantage of the intent-driven nature of the mobile channel and have designed apps that create ongoing user engagement. They are not developing static brochure-ware apps or feature-by-feature replicas of their Websites.<p>Success and failure in mobile apps comes in all shapes and sizes:<p>Toyota: Toyota has an iPhone app that is effectively a website in-an-app. Users can configure and then get a quote for their Toyota of choice. The problem: would most people think to go to the app store when considering a new car purchase? But more importantly: Is this app one that users will launch again and again? Of course not. So Toyota has missed the opportunity for ongoing engagement. What if instead the Toyota app would let Toyota owners enter their VIN number for their car and be kept up-to-date on important recall information and service schedules.<p>Heck it’s mobile: the app could see a user’s location and notify them via push notification that there is an empty service bay at the dealer just three blocks away: “Come in in the next 20 minutes and we’ll give you 20% off your oil change.” That is a real conversation providing engagement and value to the user. It’s because the story being sold isn’t about the brand it’s about the user which tends to be the stories customers actually care about.<p>Warner Brothers: Warner Brothers build apps for its successful film franchises. Think “Harry Potter” “Lord of the Rings” and “The Dark Knight.” What Warner Brothers has realized is that mobile is a new channel for delivering content new and existing. The studio prompts moviegoers to install the related app while in the seats at the theater. When they walk out after the film they are taking the Warners brand on their phones and they are ready to engage with the franchise through game play and updates about the next installments.<p>Angry Birds: The folks at Rovio are no fools. In the early days they probably saw that $0.99 apps didn’t have much of a shelf life. They took it a step further and continued offering content for their users with that original $0.99. The app just kept getting better. People talked people shared; they got their friends to play and install the game. They created a conversation by continually evolving the game.They now have a franchise and the $.99 per app is only part of their story. They built their franchise by continually engaging users with the very content they loved even though that content was delivered for free to existing users.<p>Mobile is more than download numbers. It’s about telling your customers a story they care about engaging users in a valuable way and delighting them. And what’s now possible is as futuristic as our missing jetpacks and in some ways better than we imagined. We just have to quit thinking about it as a dumb screen people stare at when they’re bored and start thinking about it as a portal to their time; a responsibility we better respect.<p>Remember: You may only get one chance to get your app installed on a user’s device. Be sure to think hard about how you create a valuable conversation for both them and you as you develop your app. If you don’t your downloads will be another example of empty numbers.,,alihassan,2.0,1302195443.0,story,2420196,,0.0,,,2011-04-07T16:57:23Z

559,,,"I like the idea of multihash.  Using a registry mapping hash names to numbers seems like it might hinder adoption though.<p>If I want to use a hash that isn&#x27;t yet in multihash&#x27;s registry (or will never be because reasons but I nonetheless want to use it) what do I do?<p>I could make a forked copy of the registry where I allocate my own number to the hash but I have to guess very well what numbers will not be used by future allocations in multihash.  If I guess wrong I might have to go through every hash I&#x27;ve encoded with my forked registry and re-encode them which could be very onerous if they&#x27;re spread across s3 glacier cold storage etc.<p>If there is a well-defined set of numbers that are set aside for personal &#x2F; non-sanctioned use I have the same problem when examining hashes from other parties because they may have chosen a different number for a particular hash or we may have conflicts.  Likewise when a hash &quot;graduates&quot; from the personal space to the official mapping all the old hashes are now encoded &quot;wrong&quot;:  they&#x27;ll keep working as long as you ensure the hash keeps a number in the personal space but now you have to choose whether to when making new hashes to use the official number &quot;for consistency (with the standard)&quot; or the personal one also &quot;for consistency (with your existing hashes)&quot;.<p>It looks like every hash in multihash has a number (like 0x13) a name (like &quot;sha-512&quot;) and a description (&quot;The SHA512 Cryptographic Hash Function&quot;) [0].  I suggest letting people use e.g. &quot;{name}:{len}:{hash}&quot; if they choose to make the tradeoff in favor of readability &#x2F; portability (with lower performance and marginally higher storage cost).<p>Then when those hashes get read by some other person&#x27;s copy of multihash they&#x27;ll either map the {name} to the local number (if if it&#x27;s different from the number of the multihash library that encoded the hash) or if the {name} doesn&#x27;t show up they can throw an appropriate error.  This is forwards compatible and I think will allow more people to be comfortable adopting multihash because they won&#x27;t have to think so much up-front about how to encode hashes that aren&#x27;t in the registry.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;multiformats&#x2F;multihash&#x2F;pull&#x2F;41&#x2F;files#diff-71c19e973ffcdb60141b3cc511acadb4R59"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;multiformats&#x2F;multihash&#x2F;pull&#x2F;41&#x2F;files#diff...</a>",,philsnow,,1488145615.0,comment,13740113,13739219.0,,,,2017-02-26T21:46:55Z

It benefits customers who do make optimal decisions.<p>That deserves a longer discussion but I&#x27;ll try to sum it up. One example of a regulation that helps customers make better decisions is that misleading advertisment is banned. When I say regulation I mean that the customers collectively decided that it would be better for everyone if misleading ads were banned.

580,,,"Not really. It&#x27;s cosmology is weird.<p>The universe is kind of a mutable thing full of &quot;sentient force&quot; (it&#x27;s time travellers). When a paradox is formed it&#x27;s defense mechanism kicks in to eliminate the paradox. That defense mechanism is the good guys (the continuum).<p>Frag is associated with what you KNOW. Information is usefull but very dangerous. 
Imagine this I go to Auschwitz and see all that horror. I decide to kill Hitler and succeed. I just fragged myself because I know I killed Hitler (therefore the Holocaust never happened) yet I saw&#x2F;know what happened if he were alive. Frag is like being &quot;out of sync&quot; with the universe. If I don&#x27;t feel frag it means the good guys intervened and nullified my action. Of course as punishment they would probably frag me in another way.<p>Why do they prevent the killing of Hitler? Because they and their frieds may have&#x2F;will have seen the consequences of Hitler&#x27;s actions so it&#x27;s in their interest to prevent the paradox.<p>Practically it doesn&#x27;t matter what really happened just that it happened as remembered by the coninuum and that the consequences remain the same. Another example by some means JFK&#x27;s father is sterile. He can&#x27;t concieve JFK This is a problem as JFK is known to exist. The continuum may stealthily inseminate JFK&#x27;s mother for him to be born. In the grand scheme it may be even impossible to know if JFK&#x27;s was always sterile or if some outside force made him sterile. The universe must BE as it is remembered.<p>Higher level continuum members start realizing that in fact free will does not exist. You just have to do what you have to do and have fu doing it.

617,,,"I disagree with the letter&#x27;s approach even though the author says it works based on his experience.<p>The <i>best</i> template for getting a raise is something like this:<p><i>To Boss&#x2F;CEO  I will be resigning my position at the company to take advantage of a new opportunity.  Regards</i><p>After that email is sent you&#x27;ll then know if the managers will woo you with a salary increase to keep you or laugh and tell you not to let the door hit your ass on the way out.<p>If you&#x27;re a superstar you can leave and make more money.  The superstar programmers at DEC left and jumped shipped to Google Inc.  The superstar engineers at Lockheed &amp; Boeing got lucrative offers from SpaceX.  You&#x27;ll also get bigger raises than a measly 5% raise.  More like 20% to 100%<p>Now if you&#x27;re not at all interested in actually switching jobs your options for leverage are severely handicapped.  Even in that case I recommend a different approach than the author&#x27;s suggested text:<p>If you can&#x27;t leave the job you have to <i>explain</i> your <i>value</i> in concrete terms and why it&#x27;s not being properly compensated.<p>Option 1:  An example of leveling up the salary to your <i>actual duties</i> that management has overlooked:   <i>&quot;Since the end 2014 I&#x27;ve been tasked to manage the Linux server reliability team in addition to delivering new web apps functionality...&quot;</i>  You then ask to talk about market rate compensation for <i>management work</i>.<p>Option 2:  An example of leveling up to <i>new tasks</i> and asking for the increased compensation to go with it:  &quot;<i>I&#x27;ve been doing web app here for 2 years but I&#x27;ve noticed many inefficiencies with the Linux reliability team.  I feel I&#x27;m the right person to take additional responsibility and make the team effective but I&#x27;d like to talk about compensation...</i>&quot;   -- Basically you&#x27;re being proactive about fast-tracking a promotion to a <i>more valuable</i> role within the company.<p>The 3rd option outlined by the author is the worst situation to be in:  Doing what exactly you&#x27;ve been doing while simultaneously asking for a ~5% raise to &quot;match market surveys&quot; is a position of weakness.  The boss responds <i>&quot;ok thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention we&#x27;ll get back to you&quot;</i> ... and then they don&#x27;t bother giving you a raise.  You&#x27;ll be secretly branded as a fool if you don&#x27;t resign.<p>Lastly some stylistic choices on author&#x27;s wordcrafting I disagree with:<p><i>&quot;I have no desire to work anywhere else but lately I have been getting lots of recruiters and people I know at other companies reaching out to me to see if I&#x27;d be interested in making a move. I tell them I am not interested of course &quot;</i><p>This text is an example of &quot;trying too hard&quot;.  You don&#x27;t need to write any of that &quot;social proof&quot; stuff at all.  If your managers are intelligent they will <i>infer</i> this without you explicitly mentioning it.

With your hands on the wheel you&#x27;re always in a position to act and it&#x27;s easier to believe that there&#x27;s always something you can do to avoid disaster.,,kkennis,,1467357273.0,comment,12014382,12014346.0,,,,2016-07-01T07:14:33Z

(Answers by the way included British spy and French Resistance leader Nancy Wake world’s first programmer Ada Lovelace slave rescuer and activist Harriet Tubman and Chinese pirate Ching Shih.)

Personally I scorn at a search result of the &#x27;100 most beautiful women&#x27;. But in the large population it will probably lead to a much higher click through.
So I wonder if Google Search was oriented towards the smart crowd niche and that they changed focus towards the common and the populous.

Law makers not without a certain logic approach things from the principles of private property. Is changing a public URL considered ""conspiracy to access a computer without authorization?"" Well why would you do it intentionally? Would you jiggle my door handle to see if that would unlock it? And if it was a crappy lock and jiggling it did unlock it would it be unauthorized access to my property if you then walked in the door?<p>There is a line of thinking in the tech community that accessing data you're not supposed to access is only ""bad"" if you do something ""bad"" with it. But in meat space we enforce fences in their own right whether or not there is any other criminal activity involved. Arguably doing so makes the larger problem of ensuring that their <i>isn't</i> associated criminal activity more tractable.<p>Actually real world example: over the weekend someone stole my phone out of my (unlocked) car while it was parked in my apartment building's garage. Now let's say he hadn't stolen the phone. Just rifled through the glove box and center console. No harm no foul right? Of course not. We presume there is no good reason to be looking through someone else's car even if you fully intend not to take anything.<p>Now that doesn't mean we should treat digital boundaries the same as physical ones but I don't think it's as obvious as some people in the tech community make it out to be that there shouldn't be penalties (of some sort--the magnitude of such penalties is a whole another debate) for intentionally violating digital boundaries regardless of how well they are protected.",,rayiner,,1358834044.0,comment,5095774,5095735.0,,,,2013-01-22T05:54:04Z

And when C programmers would use that complaint as a reason not to program with templates in C++.  And when C++ programmers used that complaint as a reason not to program in languages with garbage collection.<p>The truth is that no matter what level you program at you are depending on a long toolchain that you don&#x27;t understand the details of.  You are explicitly aware of not understanding autogenerated stuff at your level.  But are ignoring how little you understand of what is underneath the level you are used to programming at.<p>Get used to it.

It was a long article.  And repeatedly got into too much detail then narrowed down the scope and got into more detail.  Over and over again.<p>You don&#x27;t actually understand how your computer or code works.  Instead you create a useful working model and proceed with that.  Said working models can include both lower levels than your usual or you can build up higher levels.  Get used to it take advantage of good tools and you will accomplish more.

However you seem to be assuming that people without degrees disappear into some kind of a time warp while everyone else is at university.<p>Team work communication planning and organisation skills can be picked up in real life environments too if anything in a better fashion.<p>When you enter employment at a young age your employer and your colleagues are more willing to show you the ropes and give you time to learn on the job considering you usually start at a low position. Then you proceed to learn real world experience for a number of years depending on how quickly you dropped out of education and how quickly you landed a job.<p>I had been working as a developer for 5 years by the time my friends of the same age finished their degrees. Put that into perspective and compare to people fresh out of university.<p>I'm not saying people with a degree have wasted their time or that it wasn't the right thing to do.

It allows players to communicate in any way they see fit from the user casual to the highly formal/competitive. That means players can organize themselves to pull weird shenanigans or play very competitively using communication to gain an edge.

Always whitelist valid input never (just) blacklist it.<p>Also I am baffled that frameworks I encountered never demanded from developer to specify <i>exactly</i> what kind of input it expects via POST &amp; co.. It is trivial to write a set of functions like this:<p><pre><code>    function input_post_email($field_name $default_value)
    function input_post_string($field_name $validation_regex $default_value)

The point here is that framework should <i>DEMAND</i> from developer to specify format of each and every input var it needs.

804,,,No it&#x27;s not a &quot;no-brainer.&quot; Copying and pasting the URL is AFAIK <i>not</i> a common use-case for the majority of browser users. I&#x27;m reminded that right now as I type this in Safari which some time ago made the decision to hide virtually all of the current URL except for the domain name. If you think back a few years farther back then you remember when URLs and search boxes had different inputs rather than the omnibox that is now standard feature across the major browsers...which means that the conscious recognition of the URL is even less likely among most users.<p>Furthermore the design trend is such that in most consumer-friendly websites users have been trained&#x2F;encouraged to share via buttons -- this is something that Google itself explicitly encourages in Google Maps -- again deemphasizing the fact that URLs are (well <i>generally</i>) available in the omni-box.<p>So I think it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption that users who copy-paste from the omnibox are relatively rare. And those that <i>do</i> do it have something that button-pushers <i>don&#x27;t</i>: the ability to examine what they&#x27;ve just copied-pasted.<p>Again I don&#x27;t think this is a case of &quot;Oh but everyone <i>should</i> know better than to blindly do such-and-such&quot; a sentiment that many of us agree is <i>wrongly</i> applied to the hitting &quot;OK&quot; on agreeing to indecipherable TOS screens. But I can see why it&#x27;s not an obvious design decision given the feature set that Google wants in its search functionality. The more I think about it the more I think it should be more incumbent upon the user to notice what they of their own volition have decided to send out as text.<p>How is that different than the expectation required of users who send out screenshots? When I want to screenshot a webpage on my desktop -- even though I intend just to show the webpage I know <i>not</i> to use the fullscreen-capture option because it will capture lots of metadata even if the browser page itself is in full screen. Same deal on an iphone in which screen-capture will leak metadata about you as a user (when the photo was taken and thus possibly your time zone. And also your carrier) unless you intentionally crop it out before sending. And cropping out photos is very unintuitive on iphones (i.e. it is not easy to do without jumping into a third party application),,danso,,1446073085.0,comment,10468014,10467877.0,,,,2015-10-28T22:58:05Z

819,,,I don't agree that it is insanity.<p>People who live close to the equator or in the middle of time zones tend not to see much point in DST. The day length doesn't vary much at the equator and if you are in the middle of a time zone then the offset doesn't vary too much.<p>If you are closer to a pole or at the edge of a time zone the offset is not ideal around the solstices. So DST is welcome for many.<p>I've heard the arguments from people close to the equator that the curtains will fade and the men will get their morning erections while they are on the bus etc. Of course it is different there in the sub-tropics.<p>If you accept that time should not be completely local (i.e. the local church tower clock is set to noon as it used to be) and not completely global (i.e. we all run on UTC and Tuesday begins at 00:00:01 which happens to be late afternoon in location X) and so that we arbitrarily assign time zones according to the rotation of our planet surely we can also adjust the time zones depending on the path of our planet around the sun.<p>Well if it works for the locals that is.

824,,,I like this. I am also reminded of something I read about agriculture and food forests. The idea was that all land &quot;wants&quot; to return to its forest state and that traditional agriculture requires constant energy inputs to hold the land in a raw tilled state that can be quickly planted. The alternative is planting multiple compatible canopies—an edible forest—so it can stably sustain itself without inputs.<p>I think something similar happens socially... Whenever you diverge from the standard model of doing things (as startups do) it requires a massive amount of energy to stay in that raw state. Markets employees everything &quot;wants&quot; to pull you back to the typical way of doing things. The forest of the status quo fights like hell to grow back.<p>So ideally what you want to do is clear a little land and ASAP plant a complete ecology that can fill that little space. I think this is where I get to the potential energy.... If you are going to have to wait a long time to plant all the different parts of the ecology you need more potential energy to hold the land open. If you are going to plant a balanced ecology right away you can get away with less energy.<p>Anyway. Mixed metaphors but I appreciate the opportunity to mix in your idea to things I&#x27;ve been thinking about.,,erikpukinskis,,1452890079.0,comment,10911921,10911368.0,,,,2016-01-15T20:34:39Z

It sounds like a whole project but it's only for your specific use it wouldn't be that much work and definitely be worth it.<p>But hand-serializing everything is a serious grind.

838,,,"I have lived in a country (Taiwan under its previous dictatorial regime in the early 1980s) where I assumed that all my postal mail domestic or foreign was read by the ruling party&#x27;s secret police as part of the delivery process. The postal service in Taiwan was always awesomely efficient when I lived there with residential mail delivery twice a day all days of the week year-round except for a brief set of holidays for Chinese New Year. Because I assumed that all my mail would be read I set up procedures to check whether any of it was seized. My dad and I would write weekly letters to each other numbered consecutively. The course of post between Taiwan and Minnesota in those days was a week or less so after a while each weekly letter would take the form of including a phrase like &quot;This is letter number 12 replying to your letter number 10 which I received on [date]&quot; and so on. As far as I can ascertain all the letters I wrote and all the letters addressed to me were delivered but I assumed that they were read by the secret police.<p>Foreign magazines and newspapers were sometimes seized and not delivered to subscribers usually when they included articles about domestic politics in Taiwan. (I learned to respect The Economist as a news source by observing how often it was seized in delivery either in entirety or with blacking out of particular articles.) Local people who could read English could pay their hard-earned money to subscribe to (rather expensive in those days) publications like The Economist or the Asian edition of the Wall Street Journal but they couldn&#x27;t count on receiving all of what they paid for.<p>The dictatorship in Taiwan eventually fell after a largely peaceful people power revolution that forced a transformation to an open political system. Along the way people I know including the father of one my children&#x27;s godparents were imprisoned for leading peaceful protests urging free and fair elections and a stop to censorship. Most people don&#x27;t have the courage to go to prison--especially prisons like those in Taiwan at the time. But courage is what it takes to undermine a dictatorship. A successful movement for greater freedom requires great courage and a degree of social trust among the movement participants that is not easy to find. Allow me to repeat advice I have shared here on Hacker News before. If you really want to be an idealistic but hard-headed freedom-fighter mobilizing an effective popular movement for more freedom wherever you live I suggest you read deeply in the publications of the Albert Einstein Institution<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeinstein.org&#x2F;organizationsde07.html</a><p>remembering that the transition from dictatorship to democracy described in those publications is an actual historical process with recent examples around the world that we can all learn from.

At many hours of the day you can't get one at all.<p>On average given the average wait time til the next train and other factors I can drive to SF about 2.5 times faster round-trip than I can reach various common destinations using CalTrain plus whatever else is available.<p>It's true that if you are commuting in rush hour only versus heavy traffic and your destination happens to be very close to a CalTrain station and you live close to the CalTrain station to begin with the train will win.

851,,,As someone semi-new to using emacs (I knew basic keybindings but never bothered to set up init files etc.) coming from the IDE world my biggest complaint was the amount of things I had to do to get vanilla emacs to behave in a civilized way even using the GUI version. I spent hours scouring peoples emacs files on GitHub to try and find all the things that looked &quot;obvious in retrospect&quot; and settings that looked silly to have turned off by default (e.g. commands that act on regions should act on lines when no region is selected). Then my second biggest complaint was the analysis paralysis of all the plugins. I&#x27;m starting to get a stable emacs file after a few months but there&#x27;s still several pieces of functionality I miss from my IDEs that I chunk out time every now and then to research and add. I think having a &quot;if you&#x27;re coming from IDEs you may want to install X Y Z&quot; page would be helpful as well as package download rankings so that people can find the popular projects (e.g. helm use-package). It should also be prominently encouraged to use something like guru-mode where it disables the arrow keys to force you to use ctrl and meta as your movement keys.<p>Also you can pry Magit from my cold dead hands.,,_asummers,,1462747827.0,comment,11656372,11655573.0,,,,2016-05-08T22:50:27Z

857,,,"<i>&#62; The Paleolithic diet is one of the dumbest ideas I've encountered in my entire life. Its followers tend to discount vast piles of medical research in favor of tiny experiments that suggest what they hope to be true. This kind of behavior is common for adherents of any fringe      diet but paleo goes a step further</i><p>While there is indeed a paleo re-enactment fringe that tries to live as they understand our ancient ancestors would not just nutrition-wise I find that there's actually a good bit of research-based and evidence-based thinking going over these ""vast piles of medical research"" you mention and finding that they don't really support the current accepted dogma of nutritional recommendations and that indeed this research is pretty flimsy itself if you were to believe Taubes Lustig Cordain Eades others and tellingly now there is an alarming increase in obesity diabetes and other chronic diseases as an apparently direct result of the      public by-and-large complying with common-wisdom ""healthy"" recommendations.<p><i>&#62; Even its concept is flawed. Some things it discards such as wheat are barely changed from what our ancestors were eating long before agriculture or town settlements</i><p>Oh? Wheat requires several months from cultivation to being ready for consumption. Perhaps it was consumed ""long before agriculture or town settlements"" but then it seems quite implausible that it would amount to anything significant in terms of nutrition not to mention that it still requires quite a bit of processing before it can be eaten so it isn't exactly readily available nutrients.<p>But lets for a moment assume that yes there have been many changes and genetic transformations to fruits nuts the meats we consume and ourselves. How is it unreasonable given the catastrophic results of following current nutritional dogma to look into our over 2 Million-       year evolutionary history for clues on what we may be doing wrong and noting that we've had agriculture for only 0.5% of that time. Even if after agriculture our rate of change multiplied 10-fold we would still have a nutritional heritage of over 95% of our history where we most        likely did not consume in general 60-80% of our nutrients from grains and certainly not from sugar or refined vegetable oils.<p>That sounds like a pretty good clue to me.<p><i>&#62; is rightfully considered a fad diet by the NHS and similar organizations</i><p>And then people all over are giving these ideas a go and lo! they're feeling better losing their excess weight reversing chronic diseases feeling energetic not having hunger ups-and-downs not feeling bloated etc. (granted this is all anecdotal evidence) And yet this is one of the dumbest ideas you've encountered in your entire life? You must be pretty lucky having a life of plentiful great ideas.<p><i>&#62; It's also horribly unsustainable. A hummer-driving vegan...</i><p>There was the shadow of a reasonable argument there. It is entirely possible that given our current population of over 6 billion people not all of us could follow the exact same diet then again there's no reason why anyone would suggest that. A good 1/5th of earth's population does not eat cattle for cultural reasons cattle is not the only meat and it can be raised sustainably (while being more nutritious) and there are other good sources of the necessary nutrients from the paleo perpective and the needs of a male vary from those of a female from a baby from a child from youth to middle age to old age from summer to winter from health       to injury to fertility vs infertility from athletes to sages etc. There's plenty of wiggle room for me to believe that it is indeed sustainable.<p>Sorry for the long post.",,tremendo,,1280223007.0,comment,1550716,1550006.0,,,,2010-07-27T09:30:07Z

909,,,I don't think the comparison is applicable here. In 1997 Apple was clearly not in a position to transition from a growth-oriented company keeping it all for investment to a profit-oriented company paying back a large chunk of its profit to shareholders. In 1997 Apple profits were minus 1 billion dollars. Even if you factor out Next buyout (400 millions) that's still deep down in the red. Not profits to distribute.<p>But that would definitely apply to 2010 Apple &#38; Microsoft : should they continue to look for growth at all cost or start paying big (bigger) dividends to shareholders? I lean toward investing... continue to try to change the world please.

But usually you just think of an object as containing all of the metadata we know about it so far and under that model this makes perfect sense.<p>To do this in 100% RESTful style you would therefore probably store details about how an account was closed in the &#x2F;accounts&#x2F;440278&#x2F;closed reference so a PUT is correct with GET &#x2F;accounts&#x2F;440278&#x2F;closed returning either a 404 for accounts which are not closed or else the metadata about how the account was closed. This could live in parallel with a cache that&#x27;s on the resource itself describing whether it was closed or not.<p>So POST or PUT with the PUT exposing more of the metadata interface to REST and POST putting more of it in the request bodies themselves.,,drostie,,1473690854.0,comment,12479984,12479891.0,,,,2016-09-12T14:34:14Z

The world would be a better place overall if drugs were legal.</i><p>I believe the same things apply to mutually agreeable transactions.  One of the main reasons subprime blew up is that the ratings agencies gave AAA ratings to the toxic CDS instruments.  AIG and several other large institutional investors such as pension funds have <i>regulatory requirements</i> to only buy AAA-rated debt in various scenarios.<p>This promotes an environment of ignoring due diligence and relying on the ratings agencies operating on 3rd-rate employees and perverse incentives.<p>My broader point is that the public is clamoring for Big Daddy to regulate away the risk.  We all want to make 15% per year risk free.  The reality is that risks are correlated with rewards and there are a wide range of investment products to match individual needs.<p>What is the right amount of regulation?  Beyond addressing information asymmetry or recognized market failures I can't imagine much.  Have the failures of the past 20 years been from too much regulation or not enough?  How do you tell?

963,,,I&#x27;m not sure anyone &#x27;should&#x27; be offended by an exploding offer. There are lots of potential factors at play. You only see people talking about exploding offers of employment when the window is relatively small - no one bats an eye when given 45 days to accept a job offer as that should give plenty of time to find other competitive offers. It&#x27;s those 3-5 day figures where candidates tend to think they smell a rat.<p>No one wants to be forced into a decision at gunpoint which is essentially what a short notice exploding offer becomes. Part of this is also dependent upon the length of the interview process and how much detail is given. If you interview with a company 10 times over a 6 week period I don&#x27;t think a short window for acceptance is overly limiting for most candidates.<p>We often see candidates trying to expedite the offer process in order to receive offers around the same time. Candidates are at their most advantageous position when they hold multiple active job offers and they have the opportunity to leverage them off each other (I&#x27;m not suggesting this tactic). Yet when companies try to expedite the acceptance process suddenly we feel that there is something dubious at play. Candidates want companies to make quick (and positive) hiring decisions yet want to take their time to maximize their ability to shop for offers.<p>More senior talent is less of a commodity than an entry-level candidate so you might expect more junior level candidates will see exploding offers more often than senior candidates. Senior talent can also leverage their experience a bit more in order to get windows increased if necessary.<p>I don&#x27;t think they should be offended as much as they should be curious as to why the company employs such tactics (assuming again that the window is short).,,fecak,,1410208876.0,comment,8287111,8286763.0,,,,2014-09-08T20:41:16Z

969,,,I've been wondering why they haven't done this for a very very long time.  The player itself has not been a source of revenue for Adobe for quite some time (they used to license Flash Lite to handset manufacturers and made money off of that) instead they make all their money by selling tools to make content for that runtime.  I'm hoping someone from Adobe is reading this because I've never really heard a rational business reason for why the Player is not open source.<p>So here are my questions for Adobe:<p>Is there still income from Flash Player licensing? If not how does keeping the Player closed source help your business interests?<p>Is it the client side DRM you have in place in the Player that's stopping you from making it open source?<p>Do you not have the resources to communicate with the community that would develop around an open sourced player (knowing that you would have spend some time to justify many things that exist in the codebase to maintain backwards compatibility)?<p>Are you concerned that a rival would clone some of the technology you developed and implement it in their proprietary player (e.g. MS but they already gave up on Silverlight)?<p>Would the sudden influx of new security patches as vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed potentially compromise the performance of the Player?<p>Are you worried that individuals with malicious intent will find new vulnerabilities and exploit them?<p>What are your  other concerns that are preventing you from open sourcing the Flash Player?,,9999,,1329936415.0,comment,3621975,3621519.0,,,,2012-02-22T18:46:55Z

The problem comes &quot;what does the interception do when it encounters an invalid certificate&quot;?<p>So for example a self-signed cert.  does it<p>a) create a &quot;valid&quot; cert itself hiding the error from the user?  This is obviously dangerous<p>b) create an &quot;invalid&quot; self-signed cert. This is messy as a user will then see a self-signed cert from the A-V vendor which they may be more or less inclined to trust<p>c) Pass the traffic through without inspection missing any potential threats<p>And that&#x27;s just one case.  SSL&#x2F;TLS interception is very hard to get right and easy to make the user&#x27;s security worse as a result.,,raesene6,,1485426305.0,comment,13490183,13490051.0,,,,2017-01-26T10:25:05Z

994,,,Many people around the world would say the same thing about the lifestyle enjoyed by the average commenter on this forum but most of us don&#x27;t think of our incomes that way. The average American does not need to live in the home size that has become desirable; they do it because they can.<p>You can&#x27;t set an arbitrary limit on when money ceases to be motivating. At $100M in net worth you no longer need to compromise on a lot of things that people with a $1M net worth have to. But at a $1M net worth you also do not have to compromise on a lot of things that people with a $100k net worth have to and so on and so forth.<p>If I had a net worth of over $100M I&#x27;d probably still do things that increase it. That doesn&#x27;t seem any more inherently greedy than my seeking to increase my net worth now when it&#x27;s orders of magnitude lower. I&#x27;d do it because it&#x27;s what I know to do and because more resources is rationally better than fewer resources.,,dsacco,,1493343535.0,comment,14216297,14215709.0,,,,2017-04-28T01:38:55Z

997,,,FYI Google Docs got worse since you looked at it. It's now at about MacWrite (circa 1984) level. Oh and it broke compatibility with old documents (something Microsoft knows not to do!).,,wrs,,1283837277.0,comment,1668161,1668132.0,,,,2010-09-07T05:27:57Z
998,,,Don&#x27;t believe a word of this. Test your own mind.<p>Don&#x27;t make conclusions. Only ask questions and observe. This stuff cannot be explained. And it cannot be logically thought about. It must be seen and experienced.<p>Don&#x27;t doubt what i have to say. Go check for yourself.,,cammil,,1494754352.0,comment,14334915,14333396.0,,,,2017-05-14T09:32:32Z
999,,,"Keep in mind that when GNU/FSF say ""free software"" they really mean it's the <i>software</i> that's free in an ""Information wants to be free"" sense. The software's freedom necessarily confers some liberties to you as well but they still feel that software whose freedom can be taken away has a lesser quality of freedom than software that is guaranteed free forever. (You'd probably say the same about people — if your freedom can easily be abridged it's worth less than inalienable freedom.)",,chc,,1283016557.0,comment,1642014,1641836.0,,,,2010-08-28T17:29:17Z
